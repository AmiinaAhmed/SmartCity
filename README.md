# Smart City
Many governments are considering adopting the smart city concept in their cities and implementing big data applications that support smart city components to reach the required level of sustainability and improve the living standards. Smart cities utilize multiple technologies to improve the performance of City Planning , transportation, energy,education services leading to higher levels of comfort of their citizens.
One of the recent technologies that has a huge potential to enhance smart city services is big data analytics

# Project Description 
 In Smart City App. represented Data Visualization in  40+ Charts of UK Smart City by different Forms Of graph.The charts are grouped based on the 7 different purposes of your visualization objective. (Correlation ,Deviation , Composition ,Ranking ,Distribution ,Change ,Groups). Using Data Analysis & Data Mining Concept.
For example, if you want to picturize the relationship between 2 variables, check out the plots under the ‘Correlation’ section. Or if you want to show how a value changed over time, look under the ‘Change’ section and so on.


An effective chart is one which:
- Conveys the right and necessary information without distorting facts.
- Simple in design, you don't  have to strain in order to get it.
- Aesthetics support the information rather than overshadow it.
- Not overloaded with information.

ِِAnd represented  solution of  one big problems faced to UK county. (Traffic Problem) Using Algorithms To  finding the shortest path for Virtual map of the state. taking in account the Traffic Costs in 80 days Predictions that each of the available roads have (based on their traffic levels).
implementing two algorithms in order to find a solution to the problem :
 - UCS: Uniform-Cost Search : https://algorithmicthoughts.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/artificial-intelligence-uniform-cost-searchucs/
 
 - IDA*: Iterative Deepening A* : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search

Shown different paths ex. (path1,path2,....) as virtual map and the solution.
